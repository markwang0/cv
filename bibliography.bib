	abstract = {In the face of climate change and population growth in coastal regions, land-use analysis efforts are more challenging than ever. Land-use decision-makers in coastal communities are burdened with the difficult choices of where to place new homes versus other assets. While there has been an increased focus on hazard mitigation and disaster resilience in the field of planning, evidence points towards continued development in risk-prone areas including flood zones. Residential development within flood zones specifically continues to be a major issue. To help counter this trend, this study introduces a novel land-use analysis method, coupling topographic flood inundation mapping techniques with digital elevation model (DEM) adaptations. This Topographic Model Scenario Generation workflow can be used by planners early in the land-use decision making process and provides an alternative to high-computational hydraulic models. The analysis also includes the identification of strengths and weaknesses of topographic models' recognition of built infrastructure assets, adding to a limited body of knowledge addressing recommended uses of such models. Levees and canals prove particularly functional in this context while detention ponds less so, likely due to a lack of total water mass accountability. Finally, we provide a functional demonstration in Southeast Texas to illustrate the workflow's ability to create multiple infrastructure scenarios and visualize their effects across different flood events.},

	abstract = {Using five years of field monitoring data, this study compares two types of roof systems that combine green roofs, cisterns, and real-time control (RTC) strategies: one optimized to reduce stormwater runoff (a fully vegetated roof with cisterns operating under a “smart detention” [SD] logic that fully empties within 24 h), and one designed to balance architectural, economic, and structural tradeoffs (a half vegetated, half bare roof with cisterns operating under a “rainwater harvesting” [RWH] logic that partially drains in anticipation of rainfall while maintaining a reserve for green roof irrigation). Both configurations demonstrated strong stormwater performance, with cisterns improving roof retention by 10.2 to 13.0\% over five years. For small to medium storms (under 25 mm), representing 71.2\% of events, both strategies prevented more than 95\% of runoff, while forecast accuracy primarily influenced larger events. Even with modest cistern sizing, the SD system captured 96.7\% and the RWH system 95.8\% of runoff from small to medium storms, approaching 100\% assuming perfect weather forecasts. Irrigation analysis showed that RWH cisterns supplied {\textasciitilde}51\% of irrigation demand, increasing to {\textasciitilde}70\% under perfect forecasts. This study is among the first to compare stormwater and irrigation outcomes from side-by-side RTC-managed roof systems over multiple years. The results underscore that the mixed green/bare roof with RWH logic provides nearly equivalent stormwater benefits while offering added value through irrigation supply, reduced structural loading, and design flexibility.},
